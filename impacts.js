                        <p>Hey kids! I'm Zoomy, your friendly satellite buddy up in the sky. Picture this: I got built down on Earth in a big workshop, with shiny wings that soak up sunlight like a flower. Then‚Äîzoom!‚Äîa rocket shot me way up here. Now I loop around your planet all day, every 90 minutes. I take pics of beaches, mountains, and even your backyard swings. I zip those photos back to Earth so people can check weather or find lost puppies on their phones. Cool, right? That's me‚ÄîZoomy, the eye in the sky!</p>
